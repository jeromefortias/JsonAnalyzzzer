This tutorial provides a foundational guide to using the Democrite library (an extension of MS Orleans). 

I will continue to expand these tutorials to help everyone develop distributed solutions for artificial intelligence, NLP, and robotics using Python and C#. My goal is to create straightforward, accessible tutorials.

Additionally, I will produce videos on YouTube and share the links here.

DÃ©mocrite is an Open Source project that Mickael Thumerel and I initiated in 2017. In 2023, we founded Nexai, an AI/Startup collective project. We proudly joined the Amexio group in May 2024. Consequently, we will be intensifying our efforts on AI applications for documents and potential enhancements to RAG (which are much needed).
